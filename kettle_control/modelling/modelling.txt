Plan for feed forward control

0) Model probes against each other
Put both probes in water bath for day
log temps

put probes in known water temp. log how long it takes for probes to read value

1)  Model heat loss/gain
  Depends on:
    Container
    volume
    pump status
    temp differential

  run logging with two probes
    With container, volume, pump constant:
      temp_1(t + 1) = temp_1(t) + Kd * (temp_0(t) - temp_1(t))

    Is linear function of temperature diff?

  Hook up scale
    Measure weight of water -> volume
    water adds thermal mass (linear) and diffusion area (linear with offset)
      cylinder -> vol = h*r^2
                  area = 2*r^2 + h*2*pi*r

      all should change Kd.
